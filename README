An eventual goal for this linker once it reaches beyond simple Atari
ST output, is to use a much more general object and link script
format, to provide broad platform support.  I'm imagining a small
sexp-based DSL for describing the encodings of relocations and
whatnot, that would be present in the object file.  The real test
would be seeing how it supported modern RISC architecture instruction
encoding.


Things to add in the linker:

Atari ST PRG target.
Atari ST bootfloppy target.
linker scripts.
Optimizing linker ideas (see Levine's Linkers and Loaders).
